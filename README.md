# Kuiper Business Plan
Apple and Google with their cloud services Google Drive, and Apple iCloud currently have the largest control of the cloud storage market in tech. A user of these services relinquishes all control of the files chosen to be stored in the cloud. Apple, and Google are fully capable of removing these files, IE Apple removes all backups after 180 days if the user chooses to turn off backups. This should be a decision made by the consumer. Although cloud technology is incredibly useful, it comes at the cost of leaving a large carbon footprint. Apple’s data centres consumed 2.344 billion kWh of electricity in 2023, Google’s energy consumption was 22 billion kWh in 2022. Google’s cloud carbon data can be found here: https://cloud.google.com/sustainability/region-carbon. Everyone deserves the right to control their data and how much power it is using for only the cost of running a harddrive. Kuiper’s cloud storage solution aims to solve these problems.

## The Solution:

Kuiper’s solution is a cloud platform hosted by the user for the user, secure, and only accessible by the individuals that the user gives permission to. This cloud platform will be hosted on what is called the Kuiper Box MK 1. 

## Kuiper Box MK 1 Feature List:
10 Tb storage
This is the baseline storage unit
Worldwide access
The home cloud must be accessible from anywhere in the world. As long as the device is running the user must be able to upload their photos.
Shareable folders
Folders can be given read access to other users through qr codes, etc. The user has full control over who has access to folders, and can make them public or private. 
Automatic photo uploads
Photos will be uploaded automatically from the user's iPhone or Android device as long as permission is given from the user. The app must be installed on the user's phone for this feature.
Power saving functionality
The user can choose to turn off the home server when there is downtime, IE at night. Of course they can also leave it perpetually running on their electricity. 
Desktop and Mobile application control panels
The user can control all their settings of the homecloud from a control panel on an app. These features include power saving functionality, and automatic photo uploads.
Upgradeable storage
There will be external SATA, NVME slots, USB ports for the user to add additional storage.
Data Encryption
All data will be encrypted in the upload and download steps
Data security
The data is secure only allowing the user to access it.
